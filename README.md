# Chakra-Alignment-Game

The goal is to align your chakras by matching your number with the target number shown at the start of each game. Each of the four chakra images is assigned a random value which you can only determine by clicking on each chakra and observing how much your number increases. Once you know the value of each chakra, click on the ones that will help you match the displayed number without going over.
